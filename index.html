                <p class="caption"> For this project, I was tasked with redesigning a website to improve its usability. In part
                    1, I select my website and identify problems with its efficiency, learnability, memorability, and
                    accessibility. Next, I started redesigning the website using lo-fi and hi-fi prototypes. These can be found
                    in part 2. Lastly, I link to the completed redesign done using HTML and CSS.

                <p class="caption">I chose Poetry Nook because I’ve used it before, and its design certainly doesn’t make it clear
                     how to navigate through the different pages. Before starting my research and making concrete observations,
                      I’m sure that I can find lots of issues this site has with efficiency, learnability, and memorability.</p>
                <h2 class="header-interior">Problems</h2>
                <div class="problems-box">
                    <div class="box">
                        <h3>Efficiency</h3>
                        <ul class="list">
                            <li>If I were a frequent user of the site, I would want an easy way to look at the newest poems. There’s no place for that on the homepage.</li>
                            <li>It also seems difficult to post my own poem. There’s no way to do that without navigating through the headers at the top of the screen.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="box">
                        <h3>Learnability</h3>
                        <ul class="list">
                            <li>It’s not immediately clear that you can post your own poetry to the site. The header says the website is a “collection of classic poems, famous poems, love poems, & more,” which does not mention the poetry competitions or any member poetry at all. While there is a section on the homepage mentioning the weekly contest, it’s not immediately clear how I can enter.</li>
                            <li>The “random image” function seems to not really fit with the theme of the website. It seems to randomly generate book or magazine covers. Also, after the first image, it stops working and sends me to a blank page if I click it again.</li>
                            <li>Visually, the layout of the page is awkward (especially without ads) and it’s not clear what I should click on first. None of the columns align and the whole page is asymmetrical. This isn’t necessarily a problem, but this doesn’t come off as an intentional design choice. The page lacks any concept of hierarchy.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="box">
                        <h3>Memorability</h3>
                        <ul class="list">
                            <li>The layout of content on screen seems to be a bit random. The sections that border each other usually aren’t related. This made it difficult for me to construct a mental model of the page once I clicked away, and I had to look to find everything again once I clicked back.</li>
                            <li>I had some trouble telling the difference between a few of the buttons at the top of the page. For example, why are poetry, stories, and rhymes separated? Where would I go if I wanted to find something I consider to be a poem, story, and rhyme?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                <div class="accessibility">
                    <h2 class="header-interior">Accessibility</h2>
                    <p class="caption">The report generated by WebAIM WAVE mostly highlighted lots of contrast errors. In particular, the blue links weren’t different enough from the grayish background. I would agree with this critique. Even though I had no problems reading the text, a colorblind person may have more trouble distinguishing between the two bright colors. The report also found some redundant text and broken links.</p>

                <p class="caption">Now, it's time to start thinking about the design of the new website. For my lo-fi prototypes, I used Balsamiq.</p>

                <img src="./2022-10-12.png"/>
                <h3>Tablet</h3>
                <img src="./2022-10-12 (1).png"/>
                <h3>Phone</h3>

                <h3>Notes/Annotations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Combined the thesaurus, rhyme finder, and random image and poem generation into “Tools.” This solves for some of the clutter and keeps the home page thematically consistent.</li>
                    <li>The page is now composed of three labeled and distinct columns. This helps establish a hierarchy and makes it more clear where to go. This also allows the user to get a more clear mental model of the site’s layout, which will help with memorability.</li>
                    <li>There’s a unique section for the weekly contest now, with a large button labeled “ENTER CONTEST.” This helps with the learnability of the site by making it easier to participate in the poetry contests. It should also help with efficiency, since it allows users to start writing faster.</li>
                    <li>Changed “Stories” to “Short Stories.” It’s a small change, but hopefully this helps separate it conceptually from the “Poetry” button.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="caption">This guide outlines some of the basic interactive components I expect to implement in my redesigned website. This was made in Figma.</p>

                <h2>High-Fidelity Prototyping</h2>
                <p class="caption">These prototypes include more detail and will look a lot like the final product. These were made with Figma.</p>

                </div>
                <h3>Annotations</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>The top bar is composed of a flex box with justify-content: space-between. There are two divs in the flex box, one containing the logo and slogan, the other containing the buttons.</li>
                    <li>The button panel and search bar are stored using the same strategy as in #1.</li>
                    <li>Main part of the page has display:flex and flex-direction: row. The elements in this flex box will be the columns.</li>
                    <li>Individual columns will have display:flex with flex-direction: column.</li>
                    <li>When the screen gets too small (tablet size), the search bar is positioned in the center of the screen below the buttons using a media tag.</li>
                    <li>The flex box that contains the columns uses flex-wrap: wrap so the columns collapse on top of each other when the screen gets small. It will also use the row-gap property to put some distance between the columns when they wrap.</li>
                    <li>The slogan disappears using a media tag when the screen gets smaller.</li>
                    <li>On a phone, the main buttons will collapse into a menu bar activated with a media tag.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Notes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The site mostly uses the same font throughout, but different text sizes and bolded text are used to create a hierarchy of content.</li>
                    <li>Buttons, the menu bar, and the search bar will change color with user input (examples in the Visual Deisgn Guide).</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="caption">At last, here's the final product. In the end, I think the website still could have used something more to catch the eye (images? icons?), but I think that the ideas I had in the first 2 parts came through in the final design. The site is also very responsive to screen size and should look good on any device.</p>
